## Climate Coach webpage dashboard

Create a file `config.py` that includes the following information:

```
GITHUB_API_TOKEN
GOOGLE_PERSPECTIVE_API_TOKEN
COMPARISON_PROJECT_LIST
PROJECT_SLUG
```

Run `issue_pr_stats.py` to get an `output.json`, which is used by `index.html` in the directory `dashboard` to generate a webpage.
